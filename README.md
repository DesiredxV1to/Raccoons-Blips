# Raccoons-Blips
An easy-to-use script, for creating blips across your FiveM maps, can be used for custom maps, or San Andreas.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Some blips are't showing why is that?
If you are using Blips from [FiveM's Docs](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/blips/) there could be a chance you are not running that game build, which is why you are not seeing the blip's show up.

### If I want blips that use a different game build to work, how do I change the server's game build?
Open up your server.cfg file, and put this anywhere in your server.cfg ```+set sv_enforceGameBuild [build]``` [build] being the build number, or name you want to use. [Click here](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/server-commands/) for FiveM's available game build's.
